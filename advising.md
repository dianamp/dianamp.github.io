I help startups navigate the world of AI. With a deep background in AI and machine learning (early ML engineer at Amazon, PhD from MIT), and over 10 years of experience across seed stage to growth stage startups (including as a 2-time AI startup CTO), I am here to guide your startup through AI integration.


### Services:

* **AI Strategy Development**: Tailor a unique AI strategy that aligns with your startup’s vision and market needs. Are you experiencing pressure from your board or CEO to integrate AI into your product? I can help you identify the most promising areas of AI-powered automation or AI-powered feature enhancement and craft an execution plan. 

* **Technology Roadmapping**: Identify and implement the most effective AI technologies to move your business forward. Are you struggling to craft a policy for using LLMs such as chatGPT, tailored to the needs and stage of your company? We can put this together and roll it out so that your team is taking advantage of the productivity boost that comes from AI, while considering risk and legalities.

* **General AI Advising**: I’ve seen many ML projects fail (and others succeed), and am familiar with the biggest pitfalls that stand in the way of success (data issues, ML engineer training, building a shiny thing with no actual market, the list goes on). We can review your product strategy and roadmap and de-risk, so that you avoid wasting precious time.
