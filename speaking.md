One of my passions is teaching and speaking. My favorite topics to speak about are machine learning and optimization.

Sometimes I branch out to speak about CTOing, data ethics, the intersection of engineering and machine learning, startups, and career stuff. 

I'd be happy to speak at your event, especially on one of the above topics!
