2023 has been the year that the music industry started to freak out about AI. The precipitating event was Gostwriter977's release of [Heart on my Sleeve](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/21/1171032649/ai-music-heart-on-my-sleeve-drake-the-weeknd), an original track that used AI-generated vocals from Drake and The Weeknd. This is the first time that AI-generated vocal spoofs have been really good - no weird robotic elements, pronounciation sounds quite normal, and the voice really does sound like the intended target.

As CTO at Pex, it's been exciting to work on one of the only tools that can help artists detect and limit these AI-generated (or, AI-augmented) tracks. I recently wrote a blog post over on the Pex blog on the topic of whether it's possible to identify AI-generated music and voices, and what Pex can do. Check it out [here](https://pex.com/blog/real-or-fake-identifying-ai-generated-music-and-voices/).
