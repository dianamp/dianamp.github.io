In the past, I’ve done a lot of my best thinking while out for a run. In college I loved taking any problem sets that required creative thinking out into the fresh air (not all psets worked for this, but algorithms ones often did). I would memorize a problem before heading out the door, and play with it while getting some exercise.

I’d fallen out of practice with this over the years, my runs have turned into walks around the neighborhood, and I have mostly swapped out problem solving for consuming audio (podcasts and audiobooks). That is, until the last few weeks. Most recently, I’ve experimented with selecting one work challenge I need to address, and taking that out for a spin (well, walk). I’m loving it, what a great swap, I’m now doing some producing rather than only consuming.
