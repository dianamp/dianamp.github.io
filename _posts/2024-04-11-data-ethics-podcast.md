Back in 2021 I made an appearance on the Data Brew podcast by [DataBricks](https://www.databricks.com/), to discuss ML/AI ethics.

Here is the description:

> Have you ever wondered how your purchasing behavior may reveal protected attributes? Or how data scientists and business play a role in combating bias? We discuss with Diana Pfeil recommendations to reduce bias and improve fairness, from SHAP to adversarial debiasing. 

I walk through what I beleive every person working on ML needs to think through and answer prior to releasing a new data product, in order to avoid getting into murky ethical territory.
