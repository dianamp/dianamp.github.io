I got caught up in the great travel disaster of 2022: Southwest canceled the flight that Greg and I were planning to take home to Denver on Christmas Day, hours after we shipped our kids off to Florida (as unaccompanied minors on a separate flight). We had planned to spend a week without kids, to ski, to work some, and breath a bit! 

So what did we do after our flight was canceled, with no alternate flights available for days? Naturally we hightailed it to the rental car office, grabbed a car that could handle some ice, and took off for a speedy Philly-to-Denver tour, filled with gas station food and music. And also an audiobook.

Upon the recommendation from my sister Lillian, we grabbed [The Untethered Soul: A Journey Beyond Yourself](https://www.amazon.com/Untethered-Soul-Journey-Beyond-Yourself-ebook/dp/B003TU29WA) by Michael Singer from the library, and proceeded to sit back and listen.

The most interesting points in this book, for me, were the discussion of the inner voice that everyone has that is constantly narrating and giving input on everything. 
Itâ€™s important to notice this voice and be able to separate yourself from its advice and (sometimes) drama. 
The book also talks about inner energies, and the heart center, and the choice to be happy. Which is great, but what I was missing was a step-by-step guidebook on how to make that happen. 
Instead of a step-by-step, the book suggests that the answer starts with a meditation practise, which can teach us to separate oneself from our inner voice, to be less reactive and more open to acute situations that come up. But it left me wanting something more.
 
I would give this book 3.5/5 stars. It had some interesting ideas and laid out a compelling vision of what is possible. It made for some fun discussions during a very long drive.
