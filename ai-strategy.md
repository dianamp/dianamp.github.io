## Your situation

Your CEO, your leadership team, and even you yourself are asking about your AI strategy, but you don’t know where to start.

There are lots of questions you need to answer for your business:
* What are we doing with AI?
* Should we be using LLMs?
* How should we be using AI to streamline our operations?
* How should we be incorporating AI into our product to improve it?
* Is our business even an appropriate fit for AI, will it distract us from finding PMF or from scaling a product that we know works?
* Is it ethical to use AI? How do we ensure we use AI in a way that does not create harm?
* How can I possibly find the time to learn and stay on top of AI advancements enough to come up with this strategy? 

As a technology leader you are comfortable owning the technical strategy for the business, but you haven’t spent your career bringing machine learning to production. 
You need help nailing an AI strategy that will serve the business.

## The AI Assessment and Strategy gets you there

The AI Assessment and Strategy will answer the above questions, and form the foundation of the AI strategy for your company. 
It includes:
* 1-2 days of on-site or remote interviews with key members of your team
* AI Assessment and Strategy, delivered 2 weeks after the on-site

The interviews will cover both technical operations and the product vision and roadmap. 
It will be important to meet with leaders with knowledge across the business (technology, product, sales, sometimes legal) to understand:
* The existing product, how it is marketed, value prop, and future vision and roadmap
* How the technology team is organized, in terms of people, roles, and process.
* The data architecture and strategy, including what data is collected
* Current internal use of AI-assisted tools

These interviews will then drive the AI Assessment and Strategy, which will include the following sections:
* Diagnosis: what challenges the company is facing, how (and if!) the company should use AI to address them
* Recommended highest-impact areas where AI can be incorporated to drive the product forward, or improve internal operations.
* Strategic roadmap for how to take action on AI projects, including personnel and tooling recommendations

**With this assessment and strategy, you will have actionable next steps, customized to your business, your team, and your company stage.**
