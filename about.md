Hello! I’m a machine learning practitioner based in Boulder, CO.

My work life has followed a simple theme: to make useful things with data. This has taken me on a journey across many roles and industries, and through many AI/ML applications. 

I’m a two-time startup CTO (first at [Lumo](https://thinklumo.com), an ML-for-air travel startup, and more recently at [Pex](https://pex.com/), a 100-person digital rights startup powering content identification for the creator economy). I’ve worked at growth stage startups (as a data scientist and manager at [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/), which was acquired by [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home) in a 4B acquisition), and at larger organizations (at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) early in my career, where I worked in the personalization/ML group to build recommendations products, plus PayPal).

Building real products is where my heart’s at, though I've also dabbled in academia. I’ve got a PhD from [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/~orc/), I’ve done some teaching (at [CU Denver](https://www.ucdenver.edu/)), and I love thinking through and solving the hardest problems. In college I studied computer science and math at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), and had a few years of obsession with theoretical computer science (graph problems, combinatorics, I love all of that).

I am a frequent speaker and former meetup and event organizer, bringing the ML community together in Boulder CO. This included the popular data meetup [Analyze Boulder](http://http://www.meetup.com/Analyze-Boulder/), the smaller but mighty [Women in Data Science & Machine Learning Boulder](https://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Women-in-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/), and co-running the data science track at [Boulder Startup Week](https://boulderstartupweek.com/). These days I tend to stay home more.

I’ve seen multiple AI hype cycles, and countless AI/ML products succeed or fail. I’m as obsessed with AI as ever, and am currently [helping startups build useful AI products](advising.md) well.

On a personal note, I love spending time outdoors and do lots of skiing, gravel biking, walking in nature, and trying to surf when near an ocean. Happy to grab coffee or walk and talk.
