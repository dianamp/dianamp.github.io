Hello! I’m a machine learning practitioner based in Boulder, CO.

Professionally my work has had a simple theme: to make useful things with data. This has taken me on a journey across many roles and industries, and through many AI/ML applications. 

I’m a two-time startup CTO (first at [Lumo](https://thinklumo.com), an ML-for-air travel startup, and more recently at [Pex](https://pex.com/), a 100-person digital rights startup where we helped creators get paid for their work using, of course, AI/ML). I’ve worked at growth stage companies (as a data scientist and later manager at [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/), which was acquired by [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home) in a 4B acquisition), and at larger organizations (at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) early in my career, where I worked in the personalization/ML group to build recommendations products, plus PayPal).

Building real products is where my heart’s at, but I also dabbled in academia. I’ve got a PhD from [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/~orc/), I’ve done some teaching (at [CU Denver](https://www.ucdenver.edu/)), and I love thinking through and solving the hardest problems. In college I studied computer science and math at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), and had a few years of obsession with theoretical computer science (graph problems, combinatorics, I love all of that).

Years ago I was a frequent speaker and meetup and event organizer, to bring the data community together in Boulder CO. This included the popular data meetup [Analyze Boulder](http://http://www.meetup.com/Analyze-Boulder/), the smaller but mighty [Women in Data Science & Machine Learning Boulder](https://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Women-in-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/), and as a data science track lead at [Boulder Startup Week](https://boulderstartupweek.com/). These days I tend to stay home more.

At this point, I’ve seen multiple AI hype cycles, I’ve seen countless AI/ML products fail (and some succeed), and I’m as obsessed with AI as ever. I’d love to help startups build useful products well.

On a personal note, I love spending time outdoors and do lots of skiing, gravel biking, walking in nature, and trying to surf when near an ocean. Happy to grab coffee or walk and talk.
